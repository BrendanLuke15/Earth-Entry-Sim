# Earth Entry Simulator
**This is a relatively simple low-fidelity sim for blunt capsules (re)entering Earth's atmosphere.**

Some features:
- Simple atmospheric model from [Braeunig's Rocket & Space Technology](http://www.braeunig.us/space/atmmodel.htm) (US Standard Atmos)
- 2D & 3D versions
- fixed aerodynamic coefficients
- 1st order entry heating and heatshield design (PICA)

-----

**Vehicle Design:**

Configure the mass, geometry, and aerodynamics of the vehicle (point mass). SpaceX Crew Dragon example from my work [here](https://space.stackexchange.com/a/55685/40257):

```
% input values: DESIGN
m = 21200/2.205; % mass of entry vehicle (kg)
Cd = 1.23; % drag coefficient
Cl = 0.27*Cd; % lift coefficient          -> modulated in flight (roll angle), used as constant "fudge factor" in this sim
d = 4; % entry vehicle diameter (m)
S = (d/2)^2*pi(); % ref. area (m^2)
BC = m/(S*Cd); % ballistic coefficient (kg/m^2)
Rn = 2; % nose radius (m)                 -> used as a "fudge factor" in this sim for heating calcs
emis = 0.9; % thermal IR emmisivity (0.9 for PICA)
```

**Entry Conditions Setup:**

**2D:**

Specify either: apoapsis height & peripsis height OR inertial entry velocity and entry flight path angle.

Example:

```
type = 'Orbital'; % specify type of entry: 'Orbital' or 'IC' (initial conditions)
if strcmp(type,'Orbital')
    Conditions = [22,419]; % periapsis and apoapsis altitudes (km) -> LEO return
else % initial conditions case
    Conditions = [-6.45,11.4]; % EFPA (째) and Entry Velocity (km/s) -> Martian direct entry return
end
```

**3D:**

Pseudo orbital elements: apoapsis height, peripsis height, inclination, (Earth) longitude of ascending node, argument of peripsis. Again SpaceX Crew Dragon example [here](https://space.stackexchange.com/a/55685/40257) & [here](https://space.stackexchange.com/a/58332/40257):

```
Conditions = [22,418]; % periapsis and apoapsis altitudes (km)

% Initial Orbit Angles
inc = 51.6; % inclination (째)           -> ISS inclination
RAAN = 127; % (Earth) longitude of ascending node (째)
w = 165; % argument of periapsis (째)    -> RAAN & w chosen to facilitate landing near Florida from the northwest
```

**Entry Heating & PICA Heat Shield Design:**

Estensive leverage of methods from [my work here](https://space.stackexchange.com/a/55725/40257). Returns a first order estimate of required stagnation point 1D heatshield thickness. Specific to the PICA material:
- Calculate Sutton & Graves convective & Martin radiative heating rates
- assume radiative equilibrium to find thermal environment around vehicle stagnation point
- use PICA ablation data and thermal properties to:
  - estimate & integrate ablation rate to find total thickness "lost"
  - 1D unsteady heat flow to determine minimum "insulation thickness" to keep bondline from failing
